## FAQs

**Q1:** What is the difference between a spiral welded pipe and a seamless pipe?
**A1:** A spiral welded pipe is formed by welding together steel plates that have been rolled into a helical shape, while a seamless pipe is made from a solid billet without any welding. Spiral welded pipes offer cost-effective solutions for large diameter applications.

**Q2:** What types of stainless steel are used in your pipes?
**A2:** We primarily use AISI 304 and AISI 316 stainless steel, known for their excellent corrosion resistance and durability.

**Q3:** Can I customize the length and diameter of the pipes?
**A3:** Yes, we offer customization options to meet specific project requirements. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for custom orders.
