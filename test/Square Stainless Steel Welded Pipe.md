## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between a welded pipe and a seamless pipe?**

**Q: How do I maintain my Square Stainless Steel Welded Pipe?**
A: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. For tougher stains, use a non-abrasive cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials.
